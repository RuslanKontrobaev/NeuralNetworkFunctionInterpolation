# Neural Network Function Interpolation
Neural network based on a multilayer perceptron for interpolation of a function of three variables

The function used for interpolation is: $f(x_1,x_2,x_3 )=x_1^3-4x_2^2+x_3-5, x_iâˆˆ[0,20]$

Normalization occurs in the range [0, 1], the activation function is a sigmoid

The size of the training sample is 200, the test sample is 40.
